## Usage Examples

#### Large language models (LLMs) can generate text in response to a prompt, which can contain instructions and information to process. For example, you can ask a model to come up with a recipe, draft an email, or summarize a document.
###### @/index.ts (Node.js Runtime)

```ts
import {generateText} from 'ai';
import {languageModel} from '@chikichat/ai';

const {text} = await generateText({
    model: languageModel('<api key>', 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'),
    system: 'You are a friendly assistant!',
    prompt: 'Why is the sky blue?',
});

console.log(text);
```

#### Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or images as vectors in a high-dimensional space. In this space, similar words are close to each other, and the distance between words can be used to measure their similarity.
###### @/index.ts (Node.js Runtime)

```ts
import {embed} from 'ai';
import {embeddingModel} from '@chikichat/ai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
    model: embeddingModel('<api key>', 'mistral/mistral-embed'),
    value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});

console.log(embedding);
```
